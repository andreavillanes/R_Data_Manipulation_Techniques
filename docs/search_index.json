Submit any issues here. Please check back for frequent updates. About the Author Andrea Villanes earned her PhD in Computer Science from NC State un 2019. She is also a 2009 graduate of the MSA program and a teaching assistant professor at the Institute for Advanced Analytics. Inspired by her aunt, who earned a Ph.D. from NC State when Villanes was young, Villanes went on to complete a second masters degree as well as a Ph.D. in computer science, deepening her knowledge of text mining, sentiment analysis, and visualization techniques. During that time she interned with Walmart, where her text mining work garnered her the Walmart Leadership Excellence Awards Scholarship. She also served a one-year term as president of NC States Women in Computer Science (WiCS) student organization. While working toward her advanced degrees in computer science, Villanes served as a teaching assistant and, later, an instructor at the Institute before being named a member of the faculty in 2019. Her longtime involvement with the MSA has afforded her opportunities to contribute to the programs continued growth and evolution over time. Her favorite part about teaching MSA students is the different backgrounds of each student, and to see each of them grow as a data scientist during the year. In addition to teaching, Villanes is actively involved in the broader data science community. She is the co-founder of Women in Technology Per√∫, which brings together women who are interested in different areas of technology, as well as the co-founder of Zunti, a new entrepreneurial venture that promotes the use of data science in companies in Latin America. Acknowledgements The author would like to thank the members of the faculty and the TAs at the Institute who provided feedback on this work.

For example, if we want to know what one plus one is, you may type: &gt; 1 + 1 We can use any arithmetic operator, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, divison, exponentiation, and modulus operations: &gt; # addition &gt; 1 + 1 &gt; &gt; # subtraction &gt; 6 - 4 &gt; &gt; # multiplication &gt; 2 * 2 &gt; &gt; # division &gt; 10 / 5 &gt; 10.2 / 5 &gt; &gt; # integer divison &gt; 15.2 %/% 5 &gt; 15.7 %/% 5 &gt; &gt; # modulus &gt; 15.2 %% 5 &gt; 15.8 %% 5 &gt; &gt; # exponential &gt; 2^3 R also provides numerous built-in functions to use in calculations, such as natural logs, exponentiation, square root, absolute value: &gt; # natural log &gt; log(10) &gt; &gt; # exponentiation &gt; exp(2) &gt; &gt; # square root &gt; sqrt(4) &gt; &gt; # absolute value &gt; abs(-4) R includes extensive facilities for accessing documentation and searching for help. This is useful to get more information about a specific function. The help() function and ? help operator in R provide access to the documentation pages for R functions. For example, to get help with the round() function, we submit the following code: #help() function help(round) #? operator ?round() 2.2 Variable Assignment A basic concept in programming is called a variable. A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 10) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R. We can then further use the variables name to access the value or the object that is stored within this variable. For example, you can assign a value 10 to a variable my_variable: &gt; my_variable &lt;- 10 To print out the value of the variable, you simply type the name of your variable: &gt; my_variable ## [1] 10 A valid variable name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters. The variable name starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number: &gt; # A variable can be operated on &gt; my_variable + 1 &gt; &gt; # And passed to a function &gt; sqrt(my_variable + 1) &gt; &gt; # To reassign a variable, just reassign in &gt; my_variable &lt;- 3000 &gt; &gt; # You can also operate on and reassign a variable to itself &gt; my_variable &lt;- my_variable + 1 2.3 Finding Variables To know all the variables currently available in the workspace we use the ls() function: &gt; print(ls()) The ls() function can also use patterns to match the variable names. &gt; # List the variables starting with the pattern &quot;var&quot;. &gt; print(ls(pattern = &quot;var&quot;)) 2.4 Deleting Variables Variables can be deleted by using the rm() function. Below we delete the variable my_var: &gt; rm(my_var) "],["data-structures.html", "Chapter 3 Data Structures", " Chapter 3 Data Structures "],["resources.html", "Chapter 4 Resources 4.1 Cheat Sheets 4.2 Programming Style 4.3 Books", " Chapter 4 Resources Here is a list of resources that might help you in your R journey: 4.1 Cheat Sheets Base R Cheat Sheet Advanced R Cheat Sheet Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr Cheat Sheet Work with strings with stringr Cheat Sheet Basic Regular Expressions in R Cheat Sheet 4.2 Programming Style Googles R Style Guide 4.3 Books R for Data Science SAS Programming for R Users "]]
