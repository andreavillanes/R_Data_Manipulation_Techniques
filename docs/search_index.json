Submit any issues here. Please check back for frequent updates. About the Author Andrea Villanes earned her PhD in Computer Science from NC State un 2019. She is also a 2009 graduate of the MSA program and a teaching assistant professor at the Institute for Advanced Analytics. Inspired by her aunt, who earned a Ph.D. from NC State when Villanes was young, Villanes went on to complete a second masters degree as well as a Ph.D. in computer science, deepening her knowledge of text mining, sentiment analysis, and visualization techniques. During that time she interned with Walmart, where her text mining work garnered her the Walmart Leadership Excellence Awards Scholarship. She also served a one-year term as president of NC States Women in Computer Science (WiCS) student organization. While working toward her advanced degrees in computer science, Villanes served as a teaching assistant and, later, an instructor at the Institute before being named a member of the faculty in 2019. Her longtime involvement with the MSA has afforded her opportunities to contribute to the programs continued growth and evolution over time. Her favorite part about teaching MSA students is the different backgrounds of each student, and to see each of them grow as a data scientist during the year. In addition to teaching, Villanes is actively involved in the broader data science community. She is the co-founder of Women in Technology Per√∫, which brings together women who are interested in different areas of technology, as well as the co-founder of Zunti, a new entrepreneurial venture that promotes the use of data science in companies in Latin America.
